# Stackoverflow badge counter, top tags and posts retrieval
## Motivation for this script
I have a tendency to go to the stackoverflow website again and again to check my reputation and badges. So I made this script to automate the process.<br> 
## What this script does
This python script counts the gold, silver and bronze badges earned by the user. It also shows the user's current reputation as well as by how much the reputation has changed on that particular date, week.<br>
It also displays the top tags for the given user as well the top posts made by the user based on both questions and answers created by the user.
##  Instructions
Run the following command in your terminal 
```python
python run.py <user_id>
```
